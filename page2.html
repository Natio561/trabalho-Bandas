		<h3>Lead Us Back: Songs of Worship
 
Celebrating a powerful and uplifting 20+ years since the original independent release of the band’s GOLD selling self-titled debut album, THIRD DAY - which Billboard has called “one of the best rock bands, period” - forges new but familiar ground on its upcoming 12th studio album, Lead Us Back: Songs of Worship.  Looking beyond the extraordinary stats and accolades including 30 #1 singles, more than 8.5 million albums sold, 24 GMA Dove Awards, four GRAMMY®s, an American Music Award and being honored as a Georgia Music Hall of Fame inductee, the band is focusing on the spirit of worship and a pure consistency that has driven all of its recordings and live performances, and has always inspired its loyal fans to draw closer to God.
